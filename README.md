# Dotfiles

---

## These are the dotfiles I use on Arch, with Hyprland! :)
**To give credit where credit is due, the files in `.config/waybar/` and `.config/wlogout/` are originally from [PROxZIMA](https://github.com/PROxZIMA/.dotfiles), although I made some edits to better suit my taste :D**

## How the hell do I use these???

### Dependencies

First off, you'll need some packages! (duh)
>[!note] Most of these are likely installed already, and dont forget to check over the list yourself before blindly installing them!
